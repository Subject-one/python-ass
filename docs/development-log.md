========================

### 15/07/2021 - 11.50am

--------------------------

## Issues and Road Blocks
**1.** Structure of the code has faults. ***In process***<br>

**2.** Adding functions has lead to certain defitions that are called upon to not work. *Could link back to a structual issue in code.* ***Fix Pending***<br>

**3.** Had an early issue with a while loop that would not stop even with a break function. ***Solved***

## Implementing Features
**1.** Definitions have been commented out but the structure is in place.<br>

**2.** The functions are about 20% completed at this stage. ***Prority: Urgent***<br>

**3.** My plan is to finish the definitions today and implement a random module.

## Testing Application
**1.** **No errors:** Introduction to application. Greeting user and taking input.<br>

**2.** **Current errors:** The following step of selecting a path between manual or random.<br>

**3.** Bug testing spreadsheet is being filled in periodically.<br>

**4.** Trello is up and running.
