## Issues and Road Blocks
--------------------------

**1.** ***Solved***<br>

> **1.1** Resolved the faults surrounding the code body. No further issues found
in code body or structure.

**2.** ***Solved***<br>
> **2.1** Scope issues are now resolved. No further issues regarding definitions sitting too far 
out from other definitions scopes.

**3.** KeyErrors have been running in multiple sections of code. Reading documentation to understand
KeyErrors better. When running the random function, it is pulling information from a function created to feed both manual and random options. The number of items in the index of certain items was not matching up. ***Solved*** <br>

## Implementing Features
--------------------------
**1.** Application now runs to 90% completion with no functions remaining commented.<br>

**2.** Functions are 95% complete. Newest addition was adding the random function. A split
that the user can decide to either manually craft the plan or at random.<br>

**3.** Currently looking at adding a function inside a bash script that will bypass all steps needed to generate a random dinner plan and just give the random meal and macro information instantly.


## Testing Application
--------------------------

**1.** User decision between building a meal manually or at random. Flow chart was used to find the nescasary paths that were needed to take for the application to perform.

**2.** Multiple tests found keyerrors becoming an issue with conflicting index results. Utilising a spreadsheet to track and stomp out further issues.

**3.** No further errors have been recorded in testing.<br>
Final testing will commence 17/07/2021. <br>

## Issues and Road Blocks
--------------------------

**1.** Structure of the code has faults. ***In process***<br>

**2.** Adding functions has led to certain definitions that are called upon to not work. *Could link back to a structual issue in code.* ***Fix Pending***<br>

**3.** Had an early issue with a while loop that would not stop even with a break function. ***Solved***

## Implementing Features
--------------------------

**1.** Definitions have been commented out but the structure is in place.<br>

**2.** The functions are about 20% completed at this stage. ***Prority: Urgent***<br>

**3.** My plan is to finish the definitions today and implement a random module.

## Testing Application
--------------------------

**1.** **No errors:** Introduction to application. Greeting user and taking input.<br>

**2.** **Current errors:** The following step of selecting a path between manual or random.<br>

**3.** Bug testing spreadsheet is being filled in periodically.<br>

**4.** Trello is up and running.
