# Help Guide - Meal Planner

## BEFORE YOU START!
You must type the following command in the terminal window to give yourself access.
> chmod +x mealplanner.sh

> To run the program, please enter './mealplanner.sh' in your terminal

## Here are some helpful commands you can use:

> '-help' To see this screen

> '-q' terminate the application

> '-r' initiate a random meal build

> '-m' initiate a manual meal build

> './mealplanner.sh --random' skips the process to just give random meal

## Useful tips

- The name you enter can be anything.
- Manual build -> Navigate with arrow keys, select choice with 'Enter' key.
- Each serving size is per person.

## What is this App?

The app gives the user an option to either randomise a meal plan, or build one manually.
For a generic run through:
1. Enter your name. (Alphanumerical is fine)
2. Choose either manual or random with -m or -r
3. If -m, use the arrow keys to build the meal plan
4. If -r, meal plan will build and give stats
5. You can either quit during -m mode with selecting Quit or CTRL-C.
